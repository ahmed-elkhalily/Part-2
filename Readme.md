For Back-end Vacancy:
Using your back-end skills,
Let's say we have a website where we want to configure product pricing as below: 
We sell Solar Pumps & currently; we have products added as Variables to give choices to customers for selecting solar panels with pumps. So, a dropdown as Solar Panel appears on the frontend. This was working great until now when we found that there is one more demand from customers.
When a customer buys a solar pump, they always need extra cable. If they need extra cable there should be a checkbox to select yes or no if yes, these cables are sold at per meter price. So, we need an input box for customers where they can enter the length of cable in meters & price will be calculated per meter.
The price of cable is also dependent on the length of the cable. For example, on some listings a number between 1 - 25 will have a price of $4.80 per meter, then from 26 - 50 meters, the price is $6 per meter. The price difference is because the longer the cable is the more heavy-duty the wire they must use. Also, another parameter with the cable price is the Voltage of the pump. Example of pricing we need:
24V pumps
Cable 2.5mm 0 to 25m ( $4.8 )
Cable 4mm2 26-50m ($6 per meter)
48V
2.5mm up to 35m ($4.8 )
35-70m 4mm2 ( $6 per meter)
72V
2.5mm up to 40m ($4.8 )
40-80m 4mm2 ( $6 per meter)
